The purpose of this AI is to determine which main color a color tone belongs to. For example you have a light blue pixel, 
the AI will say blue, if you have a dark blue pixel the AI will say also blue

In my opinion the Code right now is pretty clean, so pleasy keep it that way and also comment your changes like I did. Just write pretty code :)
